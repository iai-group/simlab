Submit a run to SimLab
======================

A run corresponds to a simulation-based evaluation of a set of conversational agents with a set of user simulators with regards to a task and metrics. To submit a run to SimLab, you need to provide a configuration file that specifies the systems to use, the task, and the metrics. The configuration file should be in the JSON format.

If you want to use your own systems, please make sure to add them to SimLab registry first. See the :doc:`add_system_to_registry` guide for more information.
