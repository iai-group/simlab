Backend API
===========

The backend API is built on top of the `Flask <https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/>`_ web framework. It serves as a middle man between the frontend and the Jenkins server that runs the simulation-based evaluation tasks. 

The specification of the API can be found `here <backend_api.html>`_.
