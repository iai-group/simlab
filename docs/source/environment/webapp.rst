Web Application
===============

The web application includes a :doc:`React-based user interface <../webapp/frontend>` and a :doc:`Flask-based backend <../webapp/backend>`. It is connected to the MongoDB database to store and retrieve data. The web application is the main point of interaction for the users of the platform.

In a nutshell, the web application has the following features:

- **Authentication**: Users can register and log in to SimLab to access its features.
- **Documentation**: Redirects users to the documentation page.
- **Experiment Requests**: Users can submit experiment requests, corresponding to a simulation-based evaluation task.
- **Dashboard**: Users can access information related to their experiments.
- **Leaderboard**: Users can access the leaderboard with the results of the experiments submitted by all users.
