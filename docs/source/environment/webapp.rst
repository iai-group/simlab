Web Application
===============

The web application includes a :doc:`React-based user interface <../webapp/frontend>` and a :doc:`Flask-based backend <../webapp/backend>`. It is connected to the MongoDB database to store and retrieve data. The web application is the main point of interaction for the users of the platform.

.. TODO:: Add more details on the features of the web application and how to interact with it.
