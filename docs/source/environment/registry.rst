Docker registry
===============

The environment includes a private Docker registry to store and manage the Docker images of the systems shared by the community. The registry is not directly accessible. Users can only add and download systems through the web application.

Note that authors of systems are responsible for maintaining their systems. A dedicated guide on how to add a system to the registry can be found :doc:`here <../guides/add_system_to_registry>`.
