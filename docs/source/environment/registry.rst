Docker registry
===============

The environment includes a private Docker registry to store and manage the Docker images of the systems shared by the community. Access to the registry is restricted to registered users. The author of a system can push the Docker image to the registry and decide whether or not to share it with the community. Note that authors are responsible for maintaining their systems. A dedicated guide on how to add a system to the registry can be found :doc:`here <../guides/add_system_to_registry>`.
