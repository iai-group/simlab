# Populate MongoDB with the following collections:
#  - tasks: list of available tasks in SimLab with their respective metadata
#  - agents: list of available agents in SimLab with their respective metadata
#  - simulators: list of available simulators in SimLab with their respective metadata
#  - metrics: list of available metrics in SimLab with their respective metadata
# Tasks and metrics should be populated by automatically parsing the tasks and metrics modules in the simlab package
# Agents and simulators should be populated with results from the private docker registry
